**TA's Response:**

Hi, the tests might not be giving enough information to figure out\ 
what eaxctly is happening. To get a better idea of the methods\\
functionality, try writing a print statement for the test to see the\
whole output. Hopefully this helps you find a solution, otherwise\ 
you can reach out again!

**Students Reply:**
    
Alright, I added the print statement which did help me figure out\
what was happening. The original method was overwiting the elements\
of the array before they were swapped. Thank You for the help!
