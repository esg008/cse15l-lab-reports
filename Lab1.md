# `cd` 
![](cd.png)

* Command `cd` with **no argument**:
  - Absolute Path: /workspaces/lecture1
  - Since there was no arguments following the `cd` command, it took us back to the home directory.
  - There is no error.
* Command `cd` with **path to directory**:
  - Absolute Path: /home/codespace
  - The `cd` command changes the directory to the given path which was lecture1.
  - There is no error.
* Command `cd` with **path to file**:
  - Absolute path: /home/codespace/lecture1
  - We received an error because the file is not a directory. The command only works with directorys not files.
    
# `ls`

* Command `ls` with **no argument**:
  - Absolute Path: /home/codespaces/lecture1
  - We are in the lecture1 directory, simply using the `ls` command we get to see all files or folders in this directory.
  - There is no error.
* Command `ls` with **path to directory**:
  - Absolute Path: /home/codespaces/lecture1
  - So using the `ls` command with the directory listed all files within the messages folder which are the txt. files. 
  - There is no error.
* Command `ls` with **path to file**:
  - Absolute Path: /home/codespaces/lecture1
  - Once again the command lists files or folders from a given directory path. In this case we tried a file that is not in the current directory which resulted in an error. We would have to change the directory to messages to acces the list of the certain file.

# `cat`

* Command `cat` with **no argument**:
  - Absolute Path: /home/codespaces/lecture1
  - There is not output if we just type the `cat` with no argument.
  - The output is an error because it didn't output anything.
